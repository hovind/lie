# [{Abandon,vapor}ware in Progress] Lie

An attempt to provide some common Lie groups definitions along with their group definitions.

Structs of note are `GroupElt<Def>`, and traits of note are `GroupDef` and `LieGroupDef`. This whole idea is a shamelessly stolen from [Graydon]s [Pergola] crate. He explains things a lot better than I ever will over there.
